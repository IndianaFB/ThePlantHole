            <h2>Cress Disasters!</h2>
            <p>I've been attempting to grow cress twice recently, with two failures and two lessons.</p>
            <p>The first attempt was using very old seeds, I believe they expired in 2019. I have succeeded in germinating very old seeds before so I assumed the date was just a number, sowed the seeds and waited hopefully to see sprouting. After a few days the result was simply a big jar of slimy seeds. Lesson one: sometimes expired <i>means</i> expired!</p>
            <p>In my second attempt, I used my new seeds, well within date. They germinated very quickly, I had sprouts after just less than a day. However when I came to examine my crop today I noticed a carpet of black mold spores forming within my growing environment. I am using an airtight sealable glass jar, thinking the warmth and moisture of such an environment would be good for the seeds. And perhaps it was, for they germinated rapidly - however I think I should have moved them to somewhere with a freer flow of air once they had germinated, to avoid molding. Lesson two: Don't use an airtight jar full of warm moist air for too long - the mold spores await!</p>

            <h2>Cress Time</h2>
            <p>More full sun today, lucky me. It was forecast as a cloudy and overcast day - I am pleasantly surprised, it has been a very calm and sunny day with bright skies. I went for a long bike ride into the countryside as a result - almost 20km!</p>
            <p>I've recently purchased a mega-bag of cress seeds - 30,000 purportedly (though I've not counted...). Cress is the first plant I ever learned to grow, when I was a kid I had a small patch that I'd grow continuously in an old plastic ice cream tub kept on my bookshelf. I am surprised it has taken me until now to try growing it as an adult. I've not sown them yet but I will very soon - I'm excited for a classic cheese salad sandwich with cottage cheese and cress! If all goes well cress-wise, I will pass on the tradition of cress cropping to my children. Might even be from the same bag, given the long date and sheer amount of seeds!</p>

            <h2>Sun! Finally!</h2>
            <p class="diary-text">Today we got more sun than we have in the past two weeks! That isn't saying much - we got maybe 5 hours of full sun in the earlier half of the day. It got cloudy and dark quickly. I can't complain, though - I will take what I can get! The tomatoes seemed to respond well, in-fact they needed water for the first time in about a fortnight. </p>
            <p class="diary-text">I went for a long walk today, almost 2 full hours, to get some sun and some peace. On my walk I passed many different kinds of flowers and seeds, like echinaceas and poppies. I've been thinking about seed collection a lot recently, since I started gardening I have noticed I pay much more attention to plants: the specific markers they share outwardly through colour, shape, lean and the like - such as precisely how brown an oil mustard pod is - can tell you a lot about the state of that particular individual at that particular time. It's a fun game to consider how time will change these characteristics, and how quickly the changes may come about. I gathered a lot of oil mustard seeds today, from the edge of a field - a few of the plants seem to have matured early, husky and builder's tea brown; this greatly contrasted to the symphony of bruised purples and reds offered by the immature crops. I haven't a clue how to grow them or if I even will, but its a nice option to have, and comes with a memory warm as the day's sun.</p>

            <h2>Pak Choi Seed Harvest</h2>
            <p class="diary-text">Apparently you can leave your flowered pak choi to go to seed and gather the pods later for infinite pak choi! I've been observing with interest as the pods have slowly grown over the recent weeks. In order to harvest mature seeds capable of germination, I must wait for them to yellow/brown and dry up, then I can take the whole plant and shake it upside down in a bag to loosen the seeds. I'm quite methodical though, even picking grass seeds out of mown grass to use later (and avoid causing a grass attack to occur when using the dried grass as mulch!) - because of this I am more likely to handle each individual pod and extract every possible seed. That's a nice Saturday afternoon for me. I'll make a to-do list and add "collect pak choi seeds and learn how to germinate them". Infinite pak choi...</p>
