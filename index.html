            <p class="diary-text">Apparently you can leave your flowered pak choi to go to seed and gather the pods later for infinite pak choi!

In order to harvest mature seeds capable of germination, I must wait for them to yellow/brown and dry up, then I can take the whole plant and shake it upside down in a bag to loosen the seeds. I'm quite methodical though, even picking grass seeds out of mown grass to use later (and avoid causing a grass attack to occur when using the dried grass as mulch!) - because of this I am more likely to handle each individual pod and extract every possible seed. That's a nice Saturday afternoon for me. I'll make a to-do list and add "collect pak choi seeds and learn how to germinate them". Infinite pak choi...</p>
